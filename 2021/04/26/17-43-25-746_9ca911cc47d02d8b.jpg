This bid, which will see the company go private, is a big hike on its latest share price. The deal has been endorsed by Proofpoint&#8217;s board.

Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $31.5 million, or $0.49 per share, the company said.<\/p>\n<p>The acquisition news is coming in the wake of Proofpoint making a number of acquisitions of its own over the years.

It\u2019s that CIOs or CISOs typically look right past them if their resumes don\u2019t have a very specific list of qualifications.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, hiring managers expect applicants to be fully trained on all the technologies their organization currently uses. That not only makes it harder to find qualified candidates, but it also reduces the diversity of experience within security teams \u2014 which, ultimately, may weaken the company\u2019s security capabilities <em>and<\/em> its talent pool.<\/p>\n<p>At Netskope, we take a different approach to staffing for security roles. We know we can teach the cybersecurity skills needed to do the job, so instead, there are two traits we consider more important than specific technical expertise: One is a hunger to learn more about security, which suggests the individual will take the initiative to continuously improve their skills. The other is possession of a skill set that no one else on our security team has.<\/p>\n<h2>Overemphasis on technical skills creates an artificial talent shortage<\/h2>\n<p>To understand why I believe our approach has helped us build a stronger security team, think about the long-term benefits of hiring someone with a specific security skill set: How valuable will that exact knowledge be in several years? Probably not very.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe problem is not that these folks don\u2019t exist.

Previously, she was the CEO and co-founder of Ning, where she led the company\u2019s rapid growth to three million Ning Networks created and about 100 million users around the world in three years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Mighty Networks, Bianchini\u2019s goal is to build \u201ca creator middle class\u201d founded on community memberships, events and live online courses.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBasically we have a platform for people to create communities the way that they would create e-commerce stores,\u201d she told TechCrunch. \u201cSo what Shopify has done for e-commerce, we&#8217;re doing for digital subscriptions and digital payments where the value is around a community that is mastering something interesting or important together, and not just content alone.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company\u2019s flagship Business Plan product is aimed at new creators with the goal of giving them an easy way to get started with digital subscriptions, Bianchini said. Established brands, organizations and successful creators use the company\u2019s Mighty Pro plan to get everything Mighty Networks offers on their own branded iOS, iPad and Android apps.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mighty Networks &#8212; which operates as a SaaS business &#8212; has seen impressive growth. In 2020, ARR climbed by \u201c2.5x\u201d while annual customer growth climbed by 200%. Customers are defined as paying creators who host their community, courses and events on their own Mighty Network. The company also saw a 400% annual growth in payments, or rather in subscriptions and payments where a creator or brand will sell a membership or an online course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2143727\" style=\"width: 585px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2143727\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-2143727\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/mc-home_live_device.png?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"575\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/mc-home_live_device.png 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=150,101 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=300,202 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=768,517 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=680,458 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=1536,1034 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=2048,1379 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2143727\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Mighty Networks<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic was actually a boon to the business, as well as the fact that it launched live events last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe were able to help many businesses quickly move online &#8212; from yoga studios to leadership speakers and consultants &#8212; and now that the world is coming back, they\u2019ll be able to use the features that we\u2019ve built into the platform from day one around finding members, events and groups near them, as well as making everything via not just the web but mobile apps,\u201d Bianchini said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the startup\u2019s goals is to help people understand that they don\u2019t need massive amounts of followers (such as 1 million followers on TikTok) to be successful creators. For example, a creator charging 30 people for a subscription that amounts to around $1,000 a year can still pull in $30,000 a year. So while it\u2019s not huge, it\u2019s certainly still substantial &#8212; hence the company\u2019s intent to build a \u201ccreator middle class.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mighty Networks has more than 10,000 paying creators, brands and coaches today. Users include established creators and brands such as YouTube star Adriene Mishler, Xprize and Singularity University founder Peter Diamandis, author Luvvie Ajayi Jones, comedian Amanda Seales, Girlboss founder Sophia Amoruso and brands such as the TED conference and wellness scheduling platform MINDBODY.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cContent alone will kill the creator economy,\u201d Bianchini said. \u201cWe can\u2019t build a thriving creator movement on an exhausting, unfair dynamic where content creators rent audiences from big tech platforms, are required to produce a never-ending stream of content and get paid pennies for it, if they get paid at all. Creators need to own their own community on the internet, where members meet each other and get results and transformation.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owl Ventures Managing Director Amit Patel said his firm was impressed by Mighty Networks before it even met the company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNo company in this space has more loyal, passionate believers, and when we saw firsthand that creators could successfully build paid communities and online courses on a Mighty Network with as few as 30 members, we wanted to be a part of unlocking this creator middle class for a million more creators,\u201d Patel said in a written statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company plans to use its new capital on product development across media types, payment options and expansion into new markets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https:\/\/trypico.com\">Pico<\/a>, a New York startup that helps online creators and media companies make money and manage their customer data, announced\u00a0that it had launched an upgraded platform and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/14\/pico-2-0\/\">raised $6.5 million<\/a> in new funding.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/facebook-is-expanding-spotify-partnership-with-new-boombox-project\/\">expanded partnership<\/a> with streaming music service Spotify that would bring a new way to listen to music or podcasts directly within Facebook&#8217;s app, which it called <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/facebook-is-expanding-spotify-partnership-with-new-boombox-project\/\">Project Boombox<\/a>. Today, the companies <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.spotify.com\/2021-04-26\/share-explore-and-discover-music-and-podcasts-via-spotify-in-the-facebook-app\/\">are rolling out this integration<\/a> via a new &#8220;miniplayer&#8221; experience that will allow Facebook users to stream from Spotify through the Facebook app on iOS or Android. The feature will be available to both free Spotify users and Premium subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>The miniplayer itself is an extension of the social sharing option already supported within Spotify&#8217;s app. Now, when Spotify users are listening to content they want to share to Facebook, they&#8217;ll be able to tap the existing &#8220;Share&#8221; menu (the three-dot menu at the upper right of the screen) and then tap either &#8220;Facebook&#8221; or &#8220;Facebook News Feed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When a user posts an individual track or podcast episode to Facebook through this sharing feature, the post will now display in a new miniplayer that allows other people who come across their post to also play the content as they continue to scroll, or reshare it. (Cue MySpace vibes!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div style=\"width: 1920px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');<\/script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-2143498-1\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-Project-Landscape.mp4?_=1\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-Project-Landscape.mp4\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-Project-Landscape.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Spotify&#8217;s paid subscribers will be able to access full playback, the company says. Free users, meanwhile, will be able to hear the full shared track, not a clip. But afterwards, they&#8217;ll continue to listen to ad-supported content on Shuffle mode, just as they would in Spotify&#8217;s own app.<\/p>\n<p>One important thing to note here about how all this works is that the integration allows the music or podcast content to actually play from within the Spotify app. When a user presses play on the miniplayer, an app switch takes place so the user can log into Spotify. The miniplayer activates and controls the launch and playback in the Spotify app &#8212; which is how the playback is able continue even as the user scrolls on Facebook or if they minimize the Facebook app altogether.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"fNeunDTVCZ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone\/\">Facebook invests in audio with short-form Soundbites feature, podcast support and a Clubhouse clone<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook invests in audio with short-form Soundbites feature, podcast support and a Clubhouse clone&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone\/embed\/#?secret=fNeunDTVCZ\" data-secret=\"fNeunDTVCZ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>This setup means users will need to have the Spotify mobile app installed on their phone and a Spotify account for the miniplayer to work. For first-time Spotify users, they&#8217;ll have to sign up for a free account in order to listen to the music shared via the miniplayer.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify notes that it&#8217;s not possible to sign up for a paid account through the mini-player experience itself, so there&#8217;s no revenue share with Facebook on new subscriptions. (Users have to download the Spotify app and sign up for Paid accounts from there if they want to upgrade.)<\/p>\n<p>The partnership allows Spotify to leverage Facebook&#8217;s reach to gain distribution and to drive both sign-ups and repeat usage of its app just as the COVID bump to subscriber growth<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2021\/apr\/25\/spotify-expected-to-report-subscriber-slowdown-covid\"> may be wearing off<\/a>. However, it&#8217;s still responsible for the royalties paid on streams, just as it was before, the company told TechCrunch, because its app is the one actually doing the streaming. It&#8217;s also fully in charge of the music catalog and audio ads that play alongside the content.<\/p>\n<p>For Facebook, this deal means it now has a valuable tool to keep users spending time on its site &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/nielsen-the-amoung-of-time-people-spend-on-facebook-is-declining-2018-9\">a metric that has been declining<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/performance-marketing\/nielsen-facebook-declining-in-u-s-and-on-desktop\/\">over<\/a> the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/40541656\/chances-are-youre-spending-24-less-time-on-facebook\">years<\/a>, reports have indicated.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify and Facebook have a long history of working together on music efforts. Facebook back in 2011 had been planning an update that would allow music subscription users to engage with music directly on Facebook, much like this. But those plans were <a href=\"http:\/\/allthingsd.com\/20110920\/facebooks-big-f8-plans-get-dialed-back-just-a-bit\/\">later dialed back<\/a>, possibly over music rights&#8217; or technical issues. Spotify had also been one of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/why-netflix-spotify-and-others-are-friending-facebook\/\">the first media partners on Facebook&#8217;s ticker,<\/a> which would show you in real time what friends were up to on Facebook and other services. And Spotify had once offered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/how-to\/how-to-stop-or-limit-spotify-sharing-on-facebook\/\">Facebook Login<\/a> as the default for its mobile app. Today, as it has for years, Spotify users on the desktop can see what their Facebook friends are streaming on its app, thanks to social networking integrations.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Ab8cfptxkd\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/03\/ux-teardown-spotify-group-sessions\/\">Spotify Group Session UX teardown: The fails and their fixes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Spotify Group Session UX teardown: The fails and their fixes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/03\/ux-teardown-spotify-group-sessions\/embed\/#?secret=Ab8cfptxkd\" data-secret=\"Ab8cfptxkd\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The timing for this renewed and extended partnership is interesting.

specialized financial platform for financial advisors, and the company is announcing it raised a $10 million Series A led by Brian Ru and Hemant Taneja at General Catalyst. This funding is on top of the $6 million seed round it raised in 2020 from Detroit Venture Partners, Ludlow Ventures, General Catalyst and others.<\/p>\n<p>In a released statement, new board member and managing partner at Michigan-based Annox Capital Robert Mylod puts it well: &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a lot of capital investment in technologies that promise to replace financial advisors. But the bigger opportunity, by far, is to build technology that empowers advisors.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Signal was founded following CEO Patrick Kelly&#8217;s career as a financial advisor. In this capacity, he discovered the need for an end-to-end platform for financial advisors, specifically those independent and offering annuities and life insurance. Signal&#8217;s solution allows these advisors to bypass traditional distributors and simplify the sale of annuities.

real-time sign language translation promises more accessible online communication"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Sign language is used by millions of people around the world, but unlike Spanish, Mandarin or even Latin, there&#8217;s no automatic translation available for those who can&#8217;t use it. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slait.ai\/\">SLAIT<\/a> claims the first such tool available for general use, which can translate around 200 words and simple sentences to start \u2014 using nothing but an ordinary computer and webcam.<\/p>\n<p>People with hearing impairments, or other conditions that make vocal speech difficult, number in the hundreds of millions, rely on the same common tech tools as the hearing population. But while emails and text chat are useful and of course very common now, they aren&#8217;t a replacement for face-to-face communication, and unfortunately there&#8217;s no easy way for signing to be turned into written or spoken words, so this remains a significant barrier.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen attempts at automatic sign language (usually American\/ASL) translation for years and years: in 2012 Microsoft awarded its Imagine Cup to a student team that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/07\/09\/enable-talk-imagine-cup\/\">tracked hand movements with gloves<\/a>; in 2018 I wrote about SignAll, which has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/14\/signall-is-slowly-but-surely-building-a-sign-language-translation-platform\/\">working on a sign language translation booth<\/a> using multiple cameras to give 3D positioning; and in 2019 I noted that a new hand-tracking algorithm called MediaPipe, from Google&#8217;s AI labs, could lead to advances in sign detection.

Having proved the basic notion, Dom\u00e8nech was joined by co-founders Evgeny Fomin and William Vicars to start the company; they then moved on to building a system that could recognize first 100, and now 200 individual ASL gestures and some simple sentences. The translation occurs offline, and in near real time on any relatively recent phone or computer.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/slait-trans-asl-crop.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2140747\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/slait-trans-asl-crop.gif\" alt=\"Animation showing ASL signs being translated to text, and spoken words being transcribed to text back.\" width=\"729\" height=\"292\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>They plan to make it available for educational and development work, expanding their dataset so they can improve the model before attempting any more significant consumer applications.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the development of the current model was not at all simple, though it was achieved in remarkably little time by a small team. MediaPipe offered an effective, open-source method for tracking hand and finger positions, sure, but the crucial component for any strong machine learning model is data, in this case video data (since it would be interpreting video) of ASL in use \u2014 and there simply isn&#8217;t a lot of that available.<\/p>\n<p>As they recently explained <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UZ1FJP7uO9Y\">in a presentation for the DeafIT conference<\/a>, the first team evaluated using an older Microsoft database, but found that a newer Australian academic database had more and better quality data, allowing for the creation of a model that is 92 percent accurate at identifying any of 200 signs in real time. They have augmented this with sign language videos from social media (with permission, of course) and government speeches that have sign language interpreters \u2014 but they still need more.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2143831\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Deaf-Understand-Hearing-1-www.slait_.ai_.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2143831\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2143831 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Deaf-Understand-Hearing-1-www.slait_.ai_.gif\" alt=\"Animated image of a woman saying &quot;deaf understand hearing&quot; in ASL.\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2143831\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A GIF showing one of the prototypes in action \u2014 the consumer product won&#8217;t have a wireframe, obviously.<strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Slait.ai<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Their intention is to make the platform available to the deaf and ASL learner communities, who hopefully won&#8217;t mind their use of the system being turned to its improvement.<\/p>\n<p>And naturally it could prove an invaluable tool in its present state, since the company&#8217;s translation model, even as a work in progress, is still potentially transformative for many people. With the amount of video calls going on these days and likely for the rest of eternity, accessibility is being left behind \u2014 only some platforms offer automatic captioning, transcription, summaries, and certainly none recognize sign language. But with SLAIT&#8217;s tool people could sign normally and participate in a video call naturally rather than using the neglected chat function.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In the short term, we\u2019ve proven that 200 word models are accessible and our results are getting better every day,&#8221; said SLAIT&#8217;s Evgeny Fomin. &#8220;In the medium term, we plan to release a consumer facing app to track sign language. However, there is a lot of work to do to reach a comprehensive library of all sign language gestures. We are committed to making this future state a reality. Our mission is to radically improve accessibility for the Deaf and hard of hearing communities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2143839\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/slait-team.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2143839\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2143839 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/slait-team.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/slait-team.jpg 2412w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/slait-team.jpg?resize=150,62 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/slait-team.jpg?resize=300,124 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/slait-team.jpg?resize=768,318 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/slait-team.jpg?resize=680,282 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/slait-team.jpg?resize=1536,637 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/slait-team.jpg?resize=2048,849 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/slait-team.jpg?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2143839\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From left, Evgeny Fomin, Dominic Dom\u00e8nech, and Bill Vicars.<strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Slait.ai<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>He cautioned that it will not be <em>totally<\/em> complete \u2014 just as translation and transcription in or to any language is only an approximation, the point is to provide practical results for millions of people, and a few hundred words goes a long way toward doing so.

Good information, fast response, and strong execution can mean the difference between life and death. Yet, frontline workers often can\u2019t get the tools and training they need, particularly new innovations that may not wind their way easily through the government supply chain. Perhaps most importantly, they often need post-traumatic care far after a disaster his dissipated.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.riskandreturn.com\">Risk &amp; Return<\/a> is a unique venture fund and philanthropic hybrid that has set its mission to seek and finance the next-generation of technologies to help first responders not only on the frontlines, but even after as they confront the strains both physical and mental from missions they undertake.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The family of organizations sees a spectrum from emergency workers in the United States to U.S. military veterans, all of whom share similar challenges and need solutions today \u2014 solutions that can often be hard to finance for traditional VCs who aren\u2019t aware of the unique needs of this community.<\/p>\n<p>The group was founded by Robert Nelsen, who made his name as a co-founder and managing director of biotech VC leader ARCH Venture Partners, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.archventure.com\/arch-venture-partners-announces-1-46-billion-raised-in-two-new-funds-to-invest-in-transformative-biotechnology-companies\/\">which last year announced a $1.5 billion pair of funds<\/a>. He\u2019s joined by board chairman Bob Kerrey, the former co-chair of the 9\/11 Commission as well as former governor and senator of Nebraska, and managing director Jeff Eggers, a Navy SEAL who served as senior director of Afghanistan and Pakistan on President Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council.<\/p>\n<p>Nelsen had been thinking through the idea when he met Kerrey, who recalled the conversation happening during a fundraising event for Navy SEALs. \u201cThere has been a lot of suffering for those who have been on the frontlines,\u201d Kerrey said. \u201cBob had this idea, and I thought it was a really smart idea, to try to take a different approach to philanthropic efforts.\u201d They linked up with Eggers and the trio brought Risk &amp; Return to fruition.<\/p>\n<p>The venture fund is $25 million, with about 35% of it already deployed. The fund has had a big emphasis on mental health for first responders, with 75% of the companies funded broadly in that category.<\/p>\n<p>The fund\u2019s first investment was into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.altoneuroscience.com\">Alto Neuroscience<\/a>, which is developing precision medicine tools to treat post-traumatic stress. The fund has also invested in behavioral management startup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.neuroflow.com\">NeuroFlow<\/a>; alternative well-being assessment tool <a href=\"https:\/\/qntfy.com\">Qntfy<\/a>; Spear Human Performance, which is a brand-new spinout focused on connecting commercial and health data sources to optimize human performance; and <a href=\"https:\/\/xtremity.com\">Xtremity<\/a>, which is designing better connection sockets for prosthetics. The fund has invested in another six startups including Perimeter, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go\/\">which I profiled a few weeks ago<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"JvSg77dDCh\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go\/\">When wildfires rage close, Perimeter wants to tell you where to go<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;When wildfires rage close, Perimeter wants to tell you where to go&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go\/embed\/#?secret=JvSg77dDCh\" data-secret=\"JvSg77dDCh\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>This isn\u2019t your typical venture portfolio, and that\u2019s exactly what Risk &amp; Return wants to focus on. Eggers said that \u201cWe love that type of technology since it has that dual purpose: going to serve the first responder on the ground, but the community is also going to benefit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While many of the startups the firm has invested in obviously have a focus on first responders, the technologies they develop don\u2019t have to be limited to just that market. Kerrey noted that \u201cEvery veteran is a civilian, [and] these aren\u2019t businesses targeting the military market.\u201d Given the last year, \u201cit\u2019s hard to find a human being in this pandemic that hasn\u2019t suffered at least some PTSD,\u201d referencing post-traumatic stress disorder. Sales to governments can be incredibly challenging, and the ultimate market for the kinds of specialized mental health services that frontline workers need may not be as commercially viable as one would hope.<\/p>\n<p>While the government does research and innovation in this category, Kerrey sees a huge opportunity for the private sector to get more involved. \u201cOne thing that you could do in the private sector that is difficult in the public sector is look for alternative therapies for PTSD,\u201d he said, noting that areas like psychedelics have intrigued the private sector even while the government would mostly not touch the category today. Risk &amp; Return has not made an investment in that space at this time though.<\/p>\n<p>Half of the returns from the fund will stream into Risk &amp; Return\u2019s philanthropic arm, which writes grants to charities along the same thesis of aiding frontline workers both on the job and after it. The organizations hope that by approaching the complicated response space with a multi-pronged approach, they can match potential needs with different sources of capital that are most appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve increasingly seen this hybrid for-profit\/non-profit venture model in other areas. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.norrsken.vc\">Norrsken<\/a> is a Swedish foundation and venture fund that is investing in areas like mental health, climate change, and other categories from the UN Sustainable Development Goals. <a href=\"https:\/\/solve.mit.edu\">MIT Solve<\/a> is another program that is working on hybrid approaches to startup innovation, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/20\/mit-solve-launches-global-challenge-around-health-security-and-pandemics\/\">such as in pandemics and health security<\/a>.

If you say no to tracking, the app will no longer be able to use Apple&#8217;s IDFA identifier to share data about your activity with data brokers and other third parties for ad-targeting purposes. It also means the app can no longer use other identifiers (like hashed email addresses) to track you, although it may be more challenging for Apple to actually enforce that part of the policy.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2143772\" style=\"width: 496px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2143772\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2143772\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?w=486\" alt=\"Apple App Tracking Transparency\" width=\"486\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg 1463w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=36,50 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2143772\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been intense debate around App Tracking Transparency in the lead up to its launch. The pro-ATT side is pretty easy to explain: There&#8217;s a tremendous amount of personal information and activity that&#8217;s being collected about consumers without their consent (as Apple outlined in a report called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/privacy\/docs\/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf\">A Day in the Life of Your Data)<\/a>, and this gives us a simple way to control that sharing.<\/p>\n<p>However, Facebook has argued that by dealing a serious blow to ad targeting, Apple is also hurting small businesses that depend on targeting to affordable, effective ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>The social network even took out ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/16\/facebook-apple-small-business\/\">declaring that it\u2019s \u201cstanding up to Apple for small businesses everywhere.&#8221;<\/a> (The Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2020\/12\/facebooks-laughable-campaign-against-apple-really-against-users-and-small\">dismissed the campaign<\/a> as &#8220;a laughable attempt from Facebook to distract you from its poor track record of anticompetitive behavior and privacy issues as it tries to derail pro-privacy changes from Apple that are bad for Facebook\u2019s business.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>Others have suggested that <a href=\"https:\/\/stratechery.com\/2021\/an-interview-with-eric-seufert-about-apple-facebook-and-mobile-advertising\/\">these changes could do &#8220;existential&#8221; damage to some developers and advertisers<\/a>, while also benefiting Apple&#8217;s bottom line.<\/p>\n<p>The full impact will depend, in part, on how many people choose to opt out of tracking. It&#8217;s hard to imagine many normal iPhone owners saying yes when these prompts start to appear \u2014 especially since developers are <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/user-privacy-and-data-use\/\">not allowed to restrict any features<\/a> based on who opts into or out of tracking. However mobile attribution company AppsFlyer says that early data suggests that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsflyer.com\/blog\/att-opt-in-rates-higher\/\">opt-in rates could be as high as 39%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"kauM17oGyL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/07\/apple-app-tracking-transparency-details\/\">Apple shares more details about its imminent App Tracking Transparency feature<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple shares more details about its imminent App Tracking Transparency feature&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/07\/apple-app-tracking-transparency-details\/embed\/#?secret=kauM17oGyL\" data-secret=\"kauM17oGyL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>iOS 14.5 \u2014 the latest version of Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system \u2014 is launching today, and with it comes a much-discussed new privacy feature called App Tracking Transparency.

And if macOS hasn&#8217;t reviewed the app \u2014 a process Apple <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/31\/apple-notarized-mac-malware\/\">calls notarization<\/a> \u2014 or if it doesn&#8217;t recognize its developer, the app won&#8217;t be allowed to run without user intervention.<\/p>\n<p>But security researcher <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cedowens\">Cedric Owens<\/a> said the bug he found in mid-March bypasses those checks and allows a malicious app to run.<\/p>\n<p>Owens told TechCrunch that the bug\u00a0allowed him to build a potentially malicious app to look like a harmless document, which when opened bypasses macOS&#8217; built-in defenses when opened.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All the user would need to do is double click \u2014 and no macOS prompts or warnings are generated,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. Owens built a proof-of-concept app disguised as a harmless document that exploits the bug to launch the Calculator app, a way of demonstrating that the bug works without dropping malware. But a malicious attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely access a user&#8217;s sensitive data simply by tricking a victim into opening a spoofed document, he explained.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2140253\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2140253\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2140253\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/popping-calc.gif\" alt=\"GIF showing a proof of concept app opening uninhibited on an unpatched macOS computer.\" width=\"900\" height=\"710\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2140253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The proof-of-concept app disguised as a harmless document running on an unpatched macOS machine. (Image: supplied)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Fearing the potential for attackers to abuse this vulnerability, Owens reported the bug to Apple.<\/p>\n<p>Apple told TechCrunch it fixed the bug in macOS 11.3. Apple also patched earlier macOS versions to prevent abuse, and pushed out updated rules to XProtect, macOS&#8217; in-built anti-malware engine, to block malware from exploiting the vulnerability.<\/p>\n<p>Owens asked Mac security researcher <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/patrickwardle\">Patrick Wardle<\/a> to investigate how \u2014 and why \u2014 the bug works. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/objective-see.com\/blog\/blog_0x64.html\">technical blog post<\/a>\u00a0today, Wardle explained that the vulnerability triggers due to a logic bug in macOS&#8217; underlying code. The bug meant that macOS was misclassifying certain app bundles and skipping security checks, allowing Owens&#8217; proof-of-concept app to run unimpeded.<\/p>\n<p>In simple terms, macOS apps aren&#8217;t a single file but a bundle of different files that the app needs to work, including a property list file that tells the application where the files it depends on are located. But Owens found that taking out this property file and building the bundle with a particular structure could trick macOS into opening the bundle \u2014 and running the code inside \u2014 without triggering any warnings.<\/p>\n<p>Wardle described the bug as rendering macOS&#8217; security features as &#8220;wholly moot.&#8221; He confirmed that Apple&#8217;s security updates have fixed the bug. &#8220;The update will now result in the correct classification of applications as bundles and ensure that untrusted, unnotarized applications will (yet again) be blocked, and thus the user protected,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>With knowledge of how the bug works, Wardle asked Mac security company Jamf to see if there was any evidence that the bug had been exploited prior to Owens&#8217; discovery. Jamf detections lead <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jbradley89\">Jaron Bradley<\/a> confirmed that a sample of the Shlayer malware family exploiting the bug was captured in early January, several months prior to Owens&#8217; discovery. Jamf also published <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jamf.com\/blog\/shlayer-malware-abusing-gatekeeper-bypass-on-macos\/\">a technical blog post<\/a> about the malware.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The malware we uncovered using this technique is an updated version of Shlayer, a family of malware that was first discovered in 2018. Shlayer is known to be one of the most abundant pieces of malware on macOS so we&#8217;ve developed a variety of detections for its many variants, and we closely track its evolution,&#8221; Bradley told TechCrunch. &#8220;One of our detections alerted us to this new variant, and upon closer inspection we discovered its use of this bypass to allow it to be installed without an end user prompt. Further analysis leads us to believe that the developers of the malware discovered the zero-day and adjusted their malware to use it, in early 2021.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Shlayer is an adware that intercepts encrypted web traffic \u2014 including HTTPS-enabled sites \u2014 and injects its own ads, making fraudulent ad money for the operators.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s often installed by tricking users into downloading fake application installers or updaters,&#8221; said Bradley. &#8220;The version of Shlayer that uses this technique does so to evade built-in malware scanning, and to launch without additional &#8216;Are you sure&#8217; prompts to the user,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The most interesting thing about this variant is that the author has taken an old version of it and modified it slightly in order to bypass security features on macOS,&#8221; said Bradley.<\/p>\n<p>Wardle has also <a href=\"https:\/\/objective-see.com\/blog\/blog_0x64.html#detections\">published a Python script<\/a> that will help users detect any past exploitation.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the first time Shlayer has evaded macOS&#8217; defenses. Last year, Wardle working with security researcher Peter Dantini found a sample of Shlayer that had been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/31\/apple-notarized-mac-malware\/\">accidentally notarized<\/a> by Apple, a process where developers submit their apps to Apple for security checks so the apps can run on millions of Macs unhindered.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WK3Y3lpMY6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/31\/apple-notarized-mac-malware\/\">Apple mistakenly approved a widely used malware to run on Macs<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple mistakenly approved a widely used malware to run on Macs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/31\/apple-notarized-mac-malware\/embed\/#?secret=WK3Y3lpMY6\" data-secret=\"WK3Y3lpMY6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple has spent years reinforcing macOS with new security features to make it tougher for malware to break in.\u00a0But a newly discovered vulnerability broke through most of macOS&#8217; newer security protections with a double-click of a malicious app, a feat not meant to be allowed under Apple&#8217;s watch.

We&#8217;ve now learned was that the acquisition was: Snap has confirmed to us that it has acquired <a href=\"https:\/\/pixel8.earth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pixel8earth<\/a>, a company developing 3D mapping technology, specifically based on crowdsourced data.<\/p>\n<p>Pixel8earth is based out of Boulder, Colorado, and four employees from the startup are joining Snap to work on map product development. Specifically, they will be building out tools that will work with Snap&#8217;s location-based augmented reality experiences along the lines of the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/11\/snapchat-boosts-its-ar-platform-with-voice-search-local-lenses-and-snapml\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Local Lenses that Snapchat introduced last June<\/a> at its annual Partner Summit developer event.<\/p>\n<p>As we&#8217;ve reported previously, we&#8217;ve heard that this year&#8217;s Partner Summit is likely to see some launches related to Snap&#8217;s wider e-commerce strategy, and we now understand that it will also feature some news on the AR mapping front, too.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear if Snap (or Snapchat) will keep Pixel8earth going, or if it will roll selected technology and further development into products like Snap Map, but given the price of the deal, it&#8217;s most likely more of a talent acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>For the record, Pixel8earth &#8212; co-founded by Sean Gorman and Pramukta Kumar, two repeat founders and mapping PhDs &#8212; had built a platform where it encouraged people (dubbed &#8220;ambassadors&#8221;) to join the platform and use their 360 cameras and other cameras to record and contribute information to the startup&#8217;s global mapping database. (In that regard, the tech was not unlike what Mapillary, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/18\/mapillary-facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">got acquired by Facebook<\/a>, had developed.)<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2143767\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png 1868w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?resize=300,170 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?resize=768,436 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?resize=680,386 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?resize=1536,872 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Snap has largely been building its mapping experiences around the idea of using maps to increase and improve engagement with its users. One of the bigger deals it&#8217;s made on that front was its acquisition in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/06\/21\/snapchat-buys-zenly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2017 of Paris-based startup Zenly<\/a>, an app that let you opt in to be able to be discovered by your friends on a map. Other mapping acquisitions have included <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/11\/snap-acquires-streetcred\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StreetCred<\/a>, announced in January of this year. StreetCred&#8217;s service was shut down after the deal, but it was also based around the idea of crowdsourcing points-of-interest and other mapping data, paying contributors in crypto tokens and putting the information &#8220;on the blockchain.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Snap&#8217;s mapping efforts already have some decent traction and differentiation as a more &#8220;personalised&#8221; map &#8212; in contrast with, for example, the very much used Google Maps experience, which is about universal accuracy and being as thorough as possible, not exactly personalised (unless you are logged in and have locations saved, but even so, not with strong social features in mind).<\/p>\n<p>At its <a href=\"https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/442043304\/files\/doc_downloads\/2021\/03\/Transcript-(Full)-v3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investor day<\/a> in February Snap noted that Snap Map was used by more than 250 million Snapchatters monthly. &#8220;On other platforms, everyone sees the same Map. But on Snapchat we are building the world&#8217;s most personal Map,&#8221; Jacob Andreou, VP product, said there. &#8220;Your Snap Map reflects your world; it features the people, places, and activities you care about, and no two are the same. The Map is built to see where your friends are and what they\u2019re up to quickly and easily. This kind of sharing is at it\u2019s best with close friends, a perfect fit for the best friends network that is unique to Snapchat. The version of the map in our app today is one that has been relentlessly improved in conversation with our community over the last two years leveraging this data-informed approach.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While some of that usage and growth will have inevitably been curtailed in the last year, given the pandemic-enforced lockdowns and reduction in travel, Evan Spiegel, Snap&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, also said last week in its earnings that this might be turning a corner.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are optimistic about the engagement trends we are seeing as the world is beginning to open up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As things began to open up in the United States in late February, we saw inflection points in key behaviors like Story posting and engagement with the Map.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And while engagement is definitely something Snap has developed, it seems monetization might well be on the cards, too.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Local, digital advertising is an established market \u2013 it has a playbook, and we\u2019re confident that this will be an important part of our business in the future,&#8221; said Peter Sellis, senior director of product, at its recent <a href=\"https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/442043304\/files\/doc_downloads\/2021\/03\/Transcript-(Full)-v3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investor day<\/a>. &#8220;But we want to do it right.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company has slowly been testing out some more commercial features like Promote Local Place to give smaller businesses, and specifically retailers, a boost, which was the first time Snap had put businesses on the Snap Map.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019re going to spend a lot of time expanding these products to work for the largest multi-location enterprises in 2021,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;but they were honestly reactive to the pandemic, and we feel that we have yet to truly build on the potential of the Map.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It seems that Pixel8earth could be a sign of how Snap and its flagship app Snapchat plan to do that.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week, when we reported that Snap paid $124 million for Fit Analytics, we also noted that, according to the SEC filing that disclosed the value of the acquisition, Snap made another deal in the same quarter for a smaller amount, $7.6 million.

Recently, Brex <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brexHQ\/status\/1369442191609913356\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launched<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/news\/faster-payments\/2021\/brex-instant-payouts-live-shopify-sellers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instant Payouts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Shopify sellers using the Weav API. It supports platform integrations such as Stripe, Square, Shopify and PayPal. (More on that later.) Since its API went live in January, \u201cthousands\u201d of businesses have used new products and services built on Weav&#8217;s infrastructure, according to Lidor. Its API call volume is growing 300% month over month, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, the startup has attracted the attention of a number of big-name investors, including institutions and the founders of prominent fintech companies. Foundation Capital led its $4.3 million seed round, which also included participation from <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Y Combinator, Abstract Ventures, Box Group, LocalGlobe, Operator Partners, Commerce Ventures and SV Angel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A slew of founders and executives also put money in the round, including Brex founders Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi; Ramp founder Karim Atiyeh; Digits founders Jeff Seibert and Wayne Chang; Hatch founder Thomson Nguyen; GoCardless founder Matt Robinson and COO Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas; Vouch founder Sam Hodges; Plaid\u2019s Charley Ma as well as executives from fintechs such as Square, Modern Treasury and Pagaya.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foundation Capital\u2019s Angus Davis said his firm has been investing in fintech infrastructure for over a decade. And personally, before he became a VC, Davis was the founder and CEO of Upserve, a commerce software company. There, he says, he witnessed firsthand \u201cthe value of transactional data to enable new types of lending products.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foundation has a thesis around the type of embedded fintech that Weav has developed, according to Davis. And it sees a large market opportunity for a new class of financial applications to come to market built atop Weav\u2019s platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe were excited by Weav&#8217;s vision of a universal API for commerce platforms,\u201d Davis wrote via email. \u201cMuch like Plaid and Envestnet brought universal APIs to banking for consumers, Weav enables a new class of B2B fintech applications for businesses.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How it works<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weav says that by using its API, companies can prompt their business customers to \u201csecurely\u201d connect their accounts with selling platforms, online marketplaces, subscription management systems and payment gateways. Once authenticated, Weav aggregates and standardizes sales, inventory and other account data across platforms and develops insights to power new products across a range of use cases, including lending and underwriting; financial planning and analysis; real-time financial services and business management tools.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the last few years, there&#8217;s been a rise of API companies, as well as openness in the financial system that&#8217;s largely been focused on consumers, Lidor points out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFor example, Plaid brings up very rich data about consumers, but when you think about businesses, oftentimes that data is still locked up in all kinds of systems,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re here to provide some of the building blocks and the access to data from everything that has to do with sales and revenue. And, we&#8217;re really excited about powering products that are meant to make the lives of small businesses and e-commerce, sellers and creators much easier and be able to get them access to financial products.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of Brex, Weav\u2019s API allows the startup to essentially offer instant access to funds that otherwise would take a few days or a few weeks for businesses to access.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSmall businesses need access as quickly as possible to their revenue so that they can fund their operations,\u201d Lidor said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brex co-CEO Henrique Dubugras said that Weav\u2019s API gives the company the ability to offer real-time funding to more customers selling on more platforms, which saved the company \u201cthousands of engineering hours\u201d and accelerated its rollout timeline by months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, the company liked what it saw, considering that its founders personally invested in Weav.

href=\"https:\/\/ramp.com\/\">Ramp<\/a> announced that it raised a two-part round <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/08\/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation\/\">worth $115 million at a $1.6 billion valuation<\/a>, this morning <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brex.com\/\">Brex<\/a> disclosed a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210426005623\/en\/Brex-Announces-Series-D-Investment-Round\">$425 million Series D<\/a> led by Tiger Global.<\/p>\n<p>The new capital marks Brex&#8217;s largest fundraise to date, and was compiled at a valuation that is more than double its most recent private valuation. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/brex\/company_financials\">Crunchbase data<\/a>, Brex&#8217;s mid-2020 Series C valued the company at just over $3.0 billion, including the investment&#8217;s $150 million in issued equity.<\/p>\n<p>The dueling rounds raised by Brex and Ramp underscore how active their product category is proving to be. Far from its roots in merely offering perk-laden corporate cards to growing companies, Brex and its myriad rivals &#8212; including Utah unicorn <a href=\"https:\/\/getdivvy.com\/\">Divvy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.airbase.com\/\">Airbase<\/a>, and others &#8212; are building software suites around their core plastic efforts to help companies manage all elements of their spending.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>A growing rift is showing in how, compared to some rivals, the categories&#8217; largest players, including Brex, Divvy and Ramp, forgo charging for their software, content to eat off other revenue sources including interchange. Airbase, in contrast, charges for its software.<\/p>\n<p><del>Don&#8217;t expect the software arms race between corporate spend startups&#8217; unicorns to lead to more corporate spend startups deriving software revenues in addition to their current income sources; each is growing their spend rapidly enough to warrant more time with their foot on the customer growth pedal over working to juice more per-customer revenue in the short-term.<\/del> Update: Boy was <em>that<\/em> wrong. Brex announced, in a separate release so we missed it at first, that they have put together a new service <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210426005625\/en\/Brex-Unveils-All-In-One-Financial-Solution-For-Businesses\">called Brex Premium<\/a> that costs $49 per month. More on that shortly, but we wanted to update this article ASAP.<\/p>\n<p>Ramp, for example, disclosed that it is nearly on a $1 billion spend-managed run rate. Brex, worth a multiple of the younger startup, is presumably above that mark.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch reached out to Brex, curious about its 2020 and Q1 2021 growth results. The company provided a statement to TechCrunch, claiming that it is &#8220;onboarding thousands of new tech and non-tech customers every month.&#8221; Brex also said that it grew its &#8220;total customer&#8221; figure by 80% in the first quarter, &#8220;with total monthly customer additions increasing by 5x.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s precisely the sort of growth that makes late-stage investors excited. TechCrunch is speaking with Brex CEO shortly; more after that call.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MV5EBdq7uT\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/10\/there-have-never-been-more-100m-fintech-rounds-than-right-now\/\">There have never been more $100M+ fintech rounds than right now<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;There have never been more $100M+ fintech rounds than right now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/10\/there-have-never-been-more-100m-fintech-rounds-than-right-now\/embed\/#?secret=MV5EBdq7uT\" data-secret=\"MV5EBdq7uT\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mere weeks after rival corporate spend startup Ramp announced that it raised a two-part round worth $115 million at a $1.6 billion valuation, this morning Brex disclosed a $425 million Series D led by Tiger Global.

efficiently, a pioneer in the space of low-code tools to help automate how apps work together is announcing a round of funding on the back of impressive early traction.<\/p>\n<p>Berlin-based <a href=\"https:\/\/n8n.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">n8n<\/a> &#8212; which provides a framework for both technical and non-technical people to synchronize and integrate data and workflows &#8212; has raised a $12 million in a Series A round of funding.<\/p>\n<p>The startup plans to use the money to continue expanding its team, which now numbers 60 people, and to expand its platform and the services it provides to users.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Currently, n8n can help link up and integrate data and functions between more than 200 established applications, as well as any custom apps or services that you might be using in your specific organization. And since launching in October 2019, the startup has picked up an impressive 16,000 users &#8212; including both developers and &#8220;citizen developers&#8221; (those whose jobs might be described as non-technical but they are not afraid to be more hands-on in trying to build in ways to work better).<\/p>\n<p>Now it wants to make the service easier for more of the latter group to get stuck in with using it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are still seen as a technical product and less of one for citizen developers,&#8221; founder and CEO Jan Oberhauser said in an interview. &#8220;Our plan is to make n8n simpler to use, so that it&#8217;s much easier to adopt. We want to give everyone technical superpowers, whether it&#8217;s the marketing team or the IT department.&#8221; That means for example building not just chatbots but more intelligent ones, or creating new ways of visualizing data in Slack or something else altogether. And n8n&#8217;s platform can also be used to build automation within products for example to monitor performance and flag when something might need maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>The round is being led by\u00a0Felicis Ventures, with Sequoia Capital, firstminute Capital and Harpoon Ventures also participating. Sequoia and firstminute <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/13\/n8n-a-fair-code-workflow-automation-platform-raises-seed-from-sequoia-as-vc-firm-steps-up-in-europe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">co-led n8n&#8217;s seed round about a year ago<\/a>, which also included participation from Eventbrite&#8217;s Kevin Hartz, Supercell&#8217;s Ilkka Paananen, and unnamed early employees of Google and Zendesk, among others. The startup has now raised around $14 million and is not disclosing valuation.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of low-code and no-code startups on the market today and many of them have been seeing a surge of in interest in the last year. It&#8217;s a trend I suspect was brought about in no small part by the arrival of Covid-19.<\/p>\n<p>The pandemic not only led to more people working remotely and relying on apps and other cloud-based services to get what they needed to do done, but in many cases it led organizations to refocus on how they were working, and what could be improved. In some cases, it also has meant a severe tightening of belts, and so companies are needing to do more with less human power, another factor leading to more proactive efforts to use software to get more out of&#8230; software.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s meant more strain on IT teams, and that too has led to more people within departments themselves getting proactive in improving their own workflows.<\/p>\n<p>Other startups in the space include <a href=\"https:\/\/bryter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bryter<\/a> (which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/07\/berlins-bryter-raises-66m-more-to-take-its-no-code-tools-for-enterprises-to-the-u-s\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raised a $66 million Series B<\/a> earlier this month) and <a href=\"https:\/\/genesis.global\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Genesis<\/a> (which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/15\/genesis-raises-45m-to-expand-its-fintech-focussed-low-code-platform-to-more-verticals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raised $45 million in March<\/a>), along with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/sequoia-buys-shares-in-elusive-startup-zapier-at-multibillion-dollar-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zapier<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/15\/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Airtable<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/22\/rows-formerly-dashdash-raises-16m-to-build-and-populate-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rows<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/27\/london-based-gyana-raises-3-9m-for-a-no-code-approach-to-data-science\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gyana<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/05\/ushur-raises-25m-for-its-no-code-platform-to-build-customer-communication-flows\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ushur<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/22\/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creatio<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/22\/easysend-raises-16m-from-intel-more-for-its-no-code-approach-to-automating-b2c-interfaces\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EasySend<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/07\/captivateiq-raises-46m-for-its-no-code-sales-commissions-platform\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CapivateIQ<\/a>, some of which are coming to the market with a variety of solutions targeting a set of generic tools, while others are building solutions for more narrow use cases.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of n8n, the company might be considered a &#8220;pioneer&#8221; in the space not just because of its focus on the growing area of low-code tools, but because of how it views the world of software.<\/p>\n<p>[gallery type=\"slideshow\" ids=\"1958989,1958987,1958986\"]<\/p>\n<p>The basic approach n8n is taking is around the idea of &#8220;fair code.&#8221; This is somewhat similar to open-source, and is analogous to a freemium-style model for the concept. The code is available in a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/n8n-io\/n8n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">public repository<\/a> and the idea is that this will never disappear (one issue many enterprises face on the bleeding edge of tech: companies and their services sometimes shut down). However, n8n itself limits how much it can be used for free, before users start to pay to use it so that n8n can monetize its work, which it does in the form of consulting and integration services. (In the case of n8n, that limit <a href=\"https:\/\/community.n8n.io\/t\/doubts-about-fair-code-license\/2502\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">looks to be up to a limit of $30,000<\/a> in support services revenues.)<\/p>\n<p>Oberhauser was an early proponent of the concept of n8n and he <a href=\"https:\/\/faircode.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">runs a site<\/a> dedicated to spreading the word. (You can also read about the different approaches to fair code, and some of what led to the creation of the concept, <a href=\"https:\/\/fosspost.org\/fair-code-open-source\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>While basic and limited access to the code will remain free, and even as a company like n8n aims to make it easier and easier for non-developers to build integrations, there will be areas that need attention to make those services accessible to the people within an organization. For starters, there is the issue of setting up the basic integration connectors, especially in cases where the software a company is using is proprietary or customized.<\/p>\n<p>There is also another issue that is likely to become more prominent as low-code and no-code tools continue to grow in popularity, and that is security. While IT departments may not have oversight of every single integration, but neither will the security teams, which means that new data vulnerabilities might well become more commonplace, too. For all of these reasons, n8n is betting that there will still be some integration and consulting involved in implementation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Almost every company needs help connecting outside and internal systems, to make it easier for people to get started,&#8221; Oberhauser said.<\/p>\n<p>Aydin Senkut, founder and managing partner of Felicis Ventures, who led the round, said that what attracted him to n8n was the extensibility of the platform &#8212; that it could be applied not just for app integration and workflow automation in those apps but a much wider set of use cases &#8212; and the very early traction of 16,000 users that it&#8217;s picked up with very little fanfare, a sign that the service has some stickiness and usefulness to it.<\/p>\n<p>And the fact that it lets developers &#8212; &#8220;citizen&#8221; or otherwise &#8212; play with so many options is also a key part of it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;W<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">e feel that data is the new oil, and one of the special things here is not just low or no-code <em>per se<\/em>, but how n8n is making it seamless and easy to connect tens or even hundreds of apps.&#8221; Senkut said that it reminded him a little of Felicis&#8217; early investment in Plaid. &#8220;Essentially, the more data and APIs you have the more valuable the company can be. I think to measure the potential of a company, look at the APIs.

alleges Google is using its monopoly power in YouTube TV carriage negotiations"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Roku is alerting its customers that they may lose access to the YouTube TV channel on its platform after negotiations with Google went south. The company alleges that Google is attempting to use its monopoly power to insist on unfair, anticompetitive terms with regard to how Roku handles search results for YouTube content, customer data and more. The email also urges Roku customers to reach out to Google to voice their concerns.<\/p>\n<p>Details of the spat were first reported by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/roku-google-youtube-tv-dispute-525316c1-4d66-44e3-a96a-40db7b10e05b.html\">Axios<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Roku says Google continues to ask for special treatment on Roku&#8217;s streaming media player platform, which today includes a dedicated search results row for YouTube that appear after a customer performs a universal voice search. Roku claims YouTube over a year ago threatened to remove the YouTube app if Roku didn&#8217;t comply with this particular demand. It now wants to ask Google to not preference its own service in the search results, as it believes this row doesn&#8217;t serve its customer base well. The row returns YouTube results at the top of the search results page, even when this isn&#8217;t relevant to what the customer was searching for in the first place, Roku explains.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In addition, Google is adding on to its earlier demands with a new series of requests to only show only YouTube or YouTube Music search results when the YouTube app is open &#8212; even overriding Roku user preferences to do so. Today, Roku allows its customers to set their own preferred music service provider for their music requests. Google&#8217;s ask that if a user presses the Roku voice search button while YouTube is open, that query returns only YouTube results. That means YouTube Music would play any music request, and YouTube search results would appear for any other request.<\/p>\n<p>Roku says this also disadvantages the customer because it doesn&#8217;t honor the user&#8217;s preferences &#8212; like if their preferred music service is Roku, for example. Also, Roku couldn&#8217;t even use the search results to tell the customer if they&#8217;ve already paid for the content being requested &#8212; like showing them a movie they&#8217;ve already bought on another service or one of their paid subscriptions that carries the title.<\/p>\n<p>There are other concerning demands as well, including asks for customer data that goes outside the realm of industry standard practices, Roku told TechCrunch. Roku says this data isn&#8217;t available to any other partners and it doesn&#8217;t want to share it with Google, either.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Google wants to reserve the right to ask for new certification requirements, as needed, for carrying YouTube &#8212; changes that could impact the cost of Roku&#8217;s hardware. By increasing the specs &#8212; say, asking for a faster processor speed or more memory &#8212; Google could close the gap between Roku&#8217;s low-end $29 device with Google&#8217;s new $50 Chromecast with Google TV. Roku admits Google has asked for those sorts of hardware changes before, but it now wants that in the YouTube TV agreement, too.<\/p>\n<p>More broadly, Roku is concerned how Google is leveraging YouTube as it asks for these changes, even though the agreement being negotiated is YouTube TV. It says its deal with YouTube is not up for renewal at this time. We understand Google may have also issued similar requests to some TV platforms, but not larger companies like Apple (for Apple TV).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Google is attempting to use its YouTube monopoly position to force Roku into accepting predatory, anti-competitive and discriminatory terms that will directly harm Roku and our users,&#8221; a Roku spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Given antitrust suits against Google, investigations by competition authorities of anti-competitive behavior and Congressional hearings into Google\u2019s practices, it should come as no surprise that Google is now demanding unfair and anti-competitive terms that harm Roku\u2019s users,&#8221; they said.<\/p>\n<p>Roku declined to say whether or not it would bring its complaints before antitrust investigators, noting that, for now, its focus on closing the deal for YouTube TV.<\/p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s common to see carriage disputes when contracts come up for renewal, those tend to involve requests for more money to allow a platform &#8212; like a pay TV provider, for example &#8212; to continue to carry a channel or group of channels. In this case, Roku says its not asking for any change in economic terms.<\/p>\n<p>In the email sent to customers this morning at 6 AM, Roku says it won&#8217;t accept Google&#8217;s terms and its &#8220;anticompetitive requirements to manipulate your search results, impact the usage of your data, and ultimately cost you more.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The full letter is below:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Roku Customer,\u200b<\/p>\n<p>We are sending this email to update you on the possibility that Google may take away your access to the YouTube TV channel on Roku. Recent negotiations with Google to carry YouTube TV have broken down because Roku cannot accept Google\u2019s unfair terms as we believe they could harm our users. \u200b<\/p>\n<p>Ensuring a great streaming experience at an exceptional value is the core of our business. We will always stand up for our users, which is why we cannot accept Google&#8217;s unfair and anticompetitive requirements to manipulate your search results, impact the usage of your data and ultimately cost you more. \u200b<\/p>\n<p>While we are deeply disappointed in Google\u2019s decision to use their monopoly power to try and force terms that will directly harm streamers, we remain committed to reaching an agreement with Google that preserves your access to YouTube TV, protects your data and ensures a level playing field for companies to compete. We encourage you to contact Google and urge them to reach an agreement to continue offering YouTube TV on Roku and to follow standard industry practices pledging not to require access to sensitive search data or to manipulate your search results. \u200b<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Google has provided a comment, which claims Roku is making inaccurate allegations.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe have been working with Roku in good faith to reach an agreement that benefits our viewers and their customers. Unfortunately, Roku often engages in these types of tactics in their negotiations. We\u2019re disappointed that they chose to make baseless claims while we continue our ongoing negotiations.

Energy is tackling energy use for cryptocurrencies and data centers and greenhouse gas emissions"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The two founders of Crusoe Energy think they may have a solution to two of the largest problems facing the planet today &#8212; the increasing energy footprint of the tech industry and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the natural gas industry.<\/p>\n<p>Crusoe, which uses excess natural gas from energy operations to power data centers and cryptocurrency mining operations, has just raised $128 million in new financing from some of the top names in the venture capital industry to build out its operations &#8212; and the timing couldn&#8217;t be better.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/04\/24\/climate\/methane-leaks-united-nations.html\">Methane emissions are emerging as a new area of focus<\/a> for researchers and policymakers focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping global warming within the 1.5 degree targets set under the Paris Agreement. And those emissions are just what Crusoe Energy is capturing to power its data centers and bitcoin mining operations.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The reason why addressing methane emissions is so critical in the short term is because these greenhouse gases trap more heat than their carbon dioxide counterparts and also dissipate more quickly. So dramatic reductions in methane emissions can do more in the short term to alleviate the global warming pressures that human industry is putting on the environment.<\/p>\n<p>And the biggest source of methane emissions is the oil and gas industry. In the U.S. alone roughly 1.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas is flared daily, said Chase Lochmiller, a co-founder of Crusoe Energy. About two thirds of that is flared in Texas with another 500 million cubic feet flared in North Dakota, where Crusoe has focused its operations to date.<\/p>\n<p>For Lochmiller, a former quant trader at some of the top American financial services institutions, and Cully Cavness, a third generation oil and gas scion, the ability to capture natural gas and harness it for computing operations is a natural combination of the two men&#8217;s interests in financial engineering and environmental preservation.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2143695\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2143695\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2143695\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-467110070.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"716\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-467110070.jpg 3000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=768,537 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=680,476 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=1536,1074 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=2048,1432 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2143695\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">NEW TOWN, ND &#8211; AUGUST 13: View of three oil wells and flaring of natural gas on The Fort Berthold Indian Reservation near New Town, ND on August 13, 2014. About 100 million dollars worth of natural gas burns off per month because a pipeline system isn&#8217;t in place yet to capture and safely transport it . The Three Affiliated Tribes on Fort Berthold represent Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nations. It&#8217;s also at the epicenter of the fracking and oil boom that has brought oil royalties to a large number of native americans living there. (Photo by Linda Davidson \/ The Washington Post via Getty Images)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The two Denver natives met in prep-school and remained friends. When Lochmiller left for MIT and Cavness headed off to Middlebury they didn&#8217;t know that they&#8217;d eventually be launching a business together. But through Lochmiller&#8217;s exposure to large scale computing and the financial services industry, and Cavness assumption of the family business they came to the conclusion that there had to be a better way to address the massive waste associated with natural gas.<\/p>\n<p>Conversation around Crusoe Energy began in 2018 when Lochmiller and Cavness went climbing in the Rockies to talk about Lochmiller&#8217;s trip to Mt. Everest.<\/p>\n<p>When the two men started building their business, the initial focus was on finding an environmentally friendly way to deal with the energy footprint of bitcoin mining operations. It was this pitch that brought the company to the attention of investors at Polychain, the investment firm started by Olaf Carlson-Wee (and Lochmiller&#8217;s former employer), and investors like Bain Capital Ventures and new investor Valor Equity Partners.<\/p>\n<p>(This was also the pitch that Lochmiller made to me to cover the company&#8217;s seed round. At the time I was skeptical of the company&#8217;s premise and was worried that the business would just be another way to prolong the use of hydrocarbons while propping up a cryptocurrency that had limited actual utility beyond a speculative hedge against governmental collapse. I was wrong on at least one of those assessments.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Regarding questions about sustainability, Crusoe has a clear standard of only pursuing projects that are net reducers of emissions. Generally the wells that Crusoe works with are already flaring and would continue to do so in the absence of Crusoe\u2019s solution. The company has turned down numerous projects where they would be a buyer of low cost gas from a traditional pipeline because they explicitly do not want to be net adders of demand and emissions,&#8221; wrote a spokesman for Valor Equity in an email. &#8220;In addition, mining is increasingly moving to renewables and Crusoe\u2019s approach to stranded energy can enable better economics for stranded or marginalized renewables, ultimately bringing more renewables into the mix. Mining can provide an interruptible base load demand that can be cut back when grid demand increases, so overall the effect to incentivize the addition of more renewable energy sources to the grid.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Other investors have since piled on including: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lowercarbon Capital, DRW Ventures, Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, KCK Group, Upper90, Winklevoss Capital, Zigg Capital and Tesla co-founder JB Straubel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company now operate 40 modular data centers powered by otherwise wasted and flared natural gas throughout <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado. Next year that number should expand to 100 units as Crusoe enters new markets such as Texas and New Mexico. Since launching in 2018, Crusoe has emerged as a scalable solution to reduce flaring through energy intensive computing such as bitcoin mining, graphical rendering, artificial intelligence model training and even protein folding simulations for COVID-19 therapeutic research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Crusoe boasts 99.9% combustion efficiency for its methane, and is also bringing additional benefits in the form of <a href=\"https:\/\/dakotacarrier.com\/crusoe-dcn-collaboration\/\">new networking buildout at its data center and mining sites<\/a>. Eventually, this networking capacity could lead to increased connectivity for rural communities surrounding the Crusoe sites.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, 80% of the company&#8217;s operations are being used for bitcoin mining, but there&#8217;s increasing demand for use in data center operations and some universities, including Lochmiller&#8217;s alma mater of MIT are looking at the company&#8217;s offerings for their own computing needs.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;That\u2019s very much in an incubated phase right now,&#8221; said Lochmiller. &#8220;A private alpha where we have a few test customers&#8230; we&#8217;ll make that available for public use later this year.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Crusoe Energy Systems should have the lowest data center operating costs in the world, according to Lochmiller and while the company will spend money to support the infrastructure buildout necessary to get the data to customers, those costs are negligible when compared to energy consumption, Lochmiller said.<\/p>\n<p>The same holds true for bitcoin mining, where the company can offer an alternative to coal powered mining operations in China and the construction of new renewable capacity that wouldn&#8217;t be used to service the grid. As cryptocurrencies look for a way to blunt criticism about the energy usage involved in their creation and distribution, Crusoe becomes an elegant solution.<\/p>\n<p>Institutional and regulatory tailwinds are also propelling the company forward. Recently New Mexico passed new laws limiting flaring and venting to no more than 2 percent of an operator&#8217;s production by April of next year and North Dakota is pushing for incentives to support on-site flare capture systems while Wyoming signed a law creating incentives for flare gas reduction applied to bitcoin mining. The world&#8217;s largest financial services firms are also taking a stand against flare gas with BlackRock calling for an end to routine flaring by 2025.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Where we view our power consumption, we draw a very clear line in our project evaluation stage where we\u2019re reducing emissions for an oil and gas projects,&#8221; Lochmiller said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The two founders of Crusoe Energy think they may have a solution to two of the largest problems facing the planet today &#8212; the increasing energy footprint of the tech industry and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the natural gas industry.

Ready?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Indian government&#8217;s move to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/24\/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling\/\">remove a number of social media posts<\/a> critical of its handling of COVID-19 was the key news item this weekend. As the country&#8217;s healthcare system buckles, and deaths spike, the move by the current administration to censor the Internet was just about as bad a look you could imagine. At least in terms of a tech response.<\/li>\n<li>Also this weekend conversation continued about Substack&#8217;s recent push to hire away well-known writers from traditionally-respected publications continued, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/new-york-times-responds-to-the-substack-boom-2021-4\">Insider reporting<\/a> that six-figure offers to join the paid newsletter platform are the norm.<\/li>\n<li>This morning we&#8217;re focused on the impending earnings deluge. Major American tech companies, along with some key social media and ecommerce names will report, giving us a look into how tech companies performed in the first quarter of 2021. We already know that the venture market was hot during the period. How business fared, however, is less clear.<\/li>\n<li>On the funding round beat, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/mighty-networks-raises-50m-to-build-a-creator-economy-for-the-masses\/\">Mighty Networks raised $50 million<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/25\/indias-lead-school-raises-30-million-to-reach-more-students\/\">LEAD School raised $30 million<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/25\/yc-backed-kidato-raises-1-4m-seed-to-scale-its-online-school-for-k-12-students-in-africa\/\">Kidato raised $1.4 million<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/25\/robo-advisor-stashaway-gets-25m-series-d-led-by-sequoia-capital-india\/\">StashAway stashed away $25 million<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/containerjournal.com\/news\/news-releases\/kyligence-raises-70-million-series-d-funding-round\/\">Kyligence put together a $70 million Series D<\/a> of its own.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Honest Company also set an early IPO price range after we stopped recording.

We know we can teach the cybersecurity skills needed to do the job, so instead, there are two traits we consider more important than specific technical expertise: One is a hunger to learn more about security, which suggests the individual will take the initiative to continuously improve their skills. The other is possession of a skill set that no one else on our security team has.<\/p>\n<h2>Overemphasis on technical skills creates an artificial talent shortage<\/h2>\n<p>To understand why I believe our approach has helped us build a stronger security team, think about the long-term benefits of hiring someone with a specific security skill set: How valuable will that exact knowledge be in several years? Probably not very.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe problem is not that these folks don\u2019t exist.

the venture firm founded by Australia\u2019s national science agency, announced today a new $250 million AUD (about $194.3 million USD) fund to invest in deep tech startups. This is Main Sequence\u2019s second fund and its oversubscribed raise included returning investors Horizons Ventures, Hostplus, Lockheed Martin, Temasek, private investors from Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Mutual Trust, and family offices.<\/p>\n<p>Launched in 2017 by government agency CSIRO (the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation), Main Sequence now manages a total of $490 million AUD, including the CSIRO Innovation Fund. The firm works closely with scientists and researchers to commercialize their technology through its \u201cventure science\u201d model.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It starts by identifying challenges, then brings together scientists, a team, industry partners and investors to launch startups. Main Sequence\u2019s second fund will look at issues including healthcare accessibility, increasing the world\u2019s food supply, industrial productivity and space. One major focus will be decarbonization and addressing climate change, and that investment area will be led by Main Sequence partner Martin Duursma.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEspecially in the deep tech space, you don\u2019t always have a company for every problem you\u2019re trying to solve. So in addition to backing great founders who are working in one of our thesis areas, we will create companies to solve the problems and we do that as a partnership instead of on our own,\u201d Main Sequence partner Mike Zimmerman told TechCrunch. Its works with universities, CSIRO\u2019s networks of 3,500 scientists across different sectors and other research agencies to find potential founders.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"fTsuPOhjer\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/11\/what-do-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-deep-tech\/\">What do we mean when we talk about deep tech?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;What do we mean when we talk about deep tech?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/11\/what-do-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-deep-tech\/embed\/#?secret=fTsuPOhjer\" data-secret=\"fTsuPOhjer\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;ll work with a research organization, get an entrepreneur-in-residence in and work with them.

introduces a new miniplayer that streams Spotify within the Facebook app"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Facebook announced last week an <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/facebook-is-expanding-spotify-partnership-with-new-boombox-project\/\">expanded partnership<\/a> with streaming music service Spotify that would bring a new way to listen to music or podcasts directly within Facebook&#8217;s app, which it called <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/facebook-is-expanding-spotify-partnership-with-new-boombox-project\/\">Project Boombox<\/a>. Today, the companies <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.spotify.com\/2021-04-26\/share-explore-and-discover-music-and-podcasts-via-spotify-in-the-facebook-app\/\">are rolling out this integration<\/a> via a new &#8220;miniplayer&#8221; experience that will allow Facebook users to stream from Spotify through the Facebook app on iOS or Android. The feature will be available to both free Spotify users and Premium subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>The miniplayer itself is an extension of the social sharing option already supported within Spotify&#8217;s app. Now, when Spotify users are listening to content they want to share to Facebook, they&#8217;ll be able to tap the existing &#8220;Share&#8221; menu (the three-dot menu at the upper right of the screen) and then tap either &#8220;Facebook&#8221; or &#8220;Facebook News Feed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When a user posts an individual track or podcast episode to Facebook through this sharing feature, the post will now display in a new miniplayer that allows other people who come across their post to also play the content as they continue to scroll, or reshare it. (Cue MySpace vibes!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div style=\"width: 1920px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');<\/script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-2143498-1\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-Project-Landscape.mp4?_=1\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-Project-Landscape.mp4\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-Project-Landscape.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Spotify&#8217;s paid subscribers will be able to access full playback, the company says. Free users, meanwhile, will be able to hear the full shared track, not a clip. But afterwards, they&#8217;ll continue to listen to ad-supported content on Shuffle mode, just as they would in Spotify&#8217;s own app.<\/p>\n<p>One important thing to note here about how all this works is that the integration allows the music or podcast content to actually play from within the Spotify app. When a user presses play on the miniplayer, an app switch takes place so the user can log into Spotify. The miniplayer activates and controls the launch and playback in the Spotify app &#8212; which is how the playback is able continue even as the user scrolls on Facebook or if they minimize the Facebook app altogether.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"fNeunDTVCZ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone\/\">Facebook invests in audio with short-form Soundbites feature, podcast support and a Clubhouse clone<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook invests in audio with short-form Soundbites feature, podcast support and a Clubhouse clone&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone\/embed\/#?secret=fNeunDTVCZ\" data-secret=\"fNeunDTVCZ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>This setup means users will need to have the Spotify mobile app installed on their phone and a Spotify account for the miniplayer to work. For first-time Spotify users, they&#8217;ll have to sign up for a free account in order to listen to the music shared via the miniplayer.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify notes that it&#8217;s not possible to sign up for a paid account through the mini-player experience itself, so there&#8217;s no revenue share with Facebook on new subscriptions. (Users have to download the Spotify app and sign up for Paid accounts from there if they want to upgrade.)<\/p>\n<p>The partnership allows Spotify to leverage Facebook&#8217;s reach to gain distribution and to drive both sign-ups and repeat usage of its app just as the COVID bump to subscriber growth<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2021\/apr\/25\/spotify-expected-to-report-subscriber-slowdown-covid\"> may be wearing off<\/a>. However, it&#8217;s still responsible for the royalties paid on streams, just as it was before, the company told TechCrunch, because its app is the one actually doing the streaming. It&#8217;s also fully in charge of the music catalog and audio ads that play alongside the content.<\/p>\n<p>For Facebook, this deal means it now has a valuable tool to keep users spending time on its site &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/nielsen-the-amoung-of-time-people-spend-on-facebook-is-declining-2018-9\">a metric that has been declining<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/performance-marketing\/nielsen-facebook-declining-in-u-s-and-on-desktop\/\">over<\/a> the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/40541656\/chances-are-youre-spending-24-less-time-on-facebook\">years<\/a>, reports have indicated.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify and Facebook have a long history of working together on music efforts. Facebook back in 2011 had been planning an update that would allow music subscription users to engage with music directly on Facebook, much like this. But those plans were <a href=\"http:\/\/allthingsd.com\/20110920\/facebooks-big-f8-plans-get-dialed-back-just-a-bit\/\">later dialed back<\/a>, possibly over music rights&#8217; or technical issues. Spotify had also been one of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/why-netflix-spotify-and-others-are-friending-facebook\/\">the first media partners on Facebook&#8217;s ticker,<\/a> which would show you in real time what friends were up to on Facebook and other services. And Spotify had once offered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/how-to\/how-to-stop-or-limit-spotify-sharing-on-facebook\/\">Facebook Login<\/a> as the default for its mobile app. Today, as it has for years, Spotify users on the desktop can see what their Facebook friends are streaming on its app, thanks to social networking integrations.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Ab8cfptxkd\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/03\/ux-teardown-spotify-group-sessions\/\">Spotify Group Session UX teardown: The fails and their fixes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Spotify Group Session UX teardown: The fails and their fixes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/03\/ux-teardown-spotify-group-sessions\/embed\/#?secret=Ab8cfptxkd\" data-secret=\"Ab8cfptxkd\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The timing for this renewed and extended partnership is interesting.

This funding is on top of the $6 million seed round it raised in 2020 from Detroit Venture Partners, Ludlow Ventures, General Catalyst and others.<\/p>\n<p>In a released statement, new board member and managing partner at Michigan-based Annox Capital Robert Mylod puts it well: &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a lot of capital investment in technologies that promise to replace financial advisors. But the bigger opportunity, by far, is to build technology that empowers advisors.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Signal was founded following CEO Patrick Kelly&#8217;s career as a financial advisor. In this capacity, he discovered the need for an end-to-end platform for financial advisors, specifically those independent and offering annuities and life insurance. Signal&#8217;s solution allows these advisors to bypass traditional distributors and simplify the sale of annuities.
